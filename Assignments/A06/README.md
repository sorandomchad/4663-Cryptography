#### Due: 10-15-2020 (Thursday @ 3:30 p.m.)

### Overview

Given a somewhat large number, determine if it is prime or if it can be factored. If it can be factored print out the prime factors.

### Requirements

- Read each number in from input file.
- Determine if it is prime, or factorable
- If it is prime write out "prime"
- If it is factorable write out the factors.
- Run your program like: `python get_factors.py input_file=numbers`

Example Input
```
231697363
709
246641520131
72490732415291
```

Example Output
```
Name: Joe Sue

Number 1: 231697363 - Factors: 419 * 607 * 911
Number 2: 709 - Prime
Number 3: 246641520131 - ???
Number 4: 72490732415291 - Factors: 249089 * 147503 * 1973
```

### Deliverables

- Create a folder called `A06` in assignments folder and place all files (source code or text) that were used.
- Follow the guidelines of [this](../../Resources/02-Readmees/README.md) to help you write a README.md for your assignment. (10% of grade).
- Include any and all files used to complete this project. 
- Your main program should be named `get_factors.py`
- The `README.md` is for you to assist anyone with necessary libraries and or the running of your program. 
- Any sources used should be in the description as well as a link to every file. 
- Examples of input and output would be helpful as well.
